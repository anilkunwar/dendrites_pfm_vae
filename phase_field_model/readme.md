**Generate the MOOSE simulation input files with script generate_moose_simulation_files.py.**

Run the simulations with MOOSE, and export data using Paraview (5.9.0)

Note: You need the source files under MooseProject directory to run the simulations. 
Remember to replace the "newt" app name to your own app name.

Note: Some simulation results may not be physically reasonable, you need to manually filter the results, or choose other ranges for different parameters.
